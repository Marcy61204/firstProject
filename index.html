<p> In February, 2020, I started a group in Facebook called Encouraging Hearts. I started Encouraging Hearts so that people could go to a page and find encouragement and prayer, and maybe even some humor. Whether you post prayer requests, encouraging memes, devotionals, inspiring words, or songs/music, etc., it doesn't matter. I wanted to be an encouragment to others in difficult times or just because. My biggest aim is for viewers to draw closer to God or give their hearts to him. So far, Encouraging Hearts has over 100 friends/followers. I am excited and hope we can get even more followers, and see what God can do with this group. </p>
